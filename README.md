### Getting Started

1\. Iinstall all the JS dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

and also:
```sh
npm run dev
```
in order to build your JS/SaaS resources.






#
### Development

You can execute the following commands:


```sh
  npm run dev
```
it builds your js files into executable scripts.
If you want to watch files during development, execute instead:

```sh
  npm run watch
```
it will watch JS files and on change it'll rebuild them, so you don't have to manually build them.
